# Robot Navigation and Exploration in Unstructured Environment using Nature Inspired Algorithm i.e. Ant colony optimization

- The objective of this is to guide the robots in an unstructured environment with the control of unstructured
obstacles using an effective hybrid approach of fuzzy logic and nature-inspired algorithm.

- In this work the implementation of fuzzy logic for unstructured obstacles avoidance and an improved version of
ant colony optimization for optimization has proposed for solving the problem.
